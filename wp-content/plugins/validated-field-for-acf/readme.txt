The Validated Field add-on for Advanced Custom Fields provides input masking and server-side validation of other field types.

== Description ==
= Validated Field Add-On =
The **Validated Field** add-on for [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
provides a wrapper for other input types which allows you to provide client side input masking using the jQuery 
[Masked Input Plugin](http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/), server side validation using either PHP regular expressions 
or PHP code, the option of ensuring a field's uniqueness for all posts by `post_type` and `meta_key`, `post_type`, or site wide, or a 
single post by meta_key, as well as marking a field as read-only. Edit your fields in the ACF Field Group editor and update code using the ACE.js
IDE with autocomplete and syntax validation.

= Features =
1. **Input Masking** - easily set masks on text inputs to ensure data is properly formatted.
2. **Server-Side Validation** - validate the inputs using server side PHP code or regular expressions.
3. **Uniqueness** - ensure that the value being updated is not already in use.
4. **Repeater Fields** - validated fields within a [Repeater Field](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/).
5. **Read Only** - specify a field as read-only allowing it to be displayed but not updated.
6. **WordPress Multi Language** - compatible with multilingual sites using the WPML plugin.
7. **Conditional Logic** - show and hide validated fields based on the values of other "switch" fields.

= Compatibility =
Requires [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) version 4.0 or greater.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin and extract to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure validated fields within the Advanced Custom Fields menus.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've activated the Validated Field plugin, but nothing happens =
Ensure that you have [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) installed and that it is activated. 
Validated Field will appear as a new input type in the field group editor.

= Configuration Options =
Global configurations for the Validated Field plugin can be found in the WordPress Admin under `Custom Fields > Validated Field Settings`.

== Screenshots ==
1. Example configuration for input masking and regular expression checking of a telephone number field.
2. Example of client-side input masking on a telephone number field.
3. Example of failing to pass a regular expression check (phone number is incomplete).
4. Example of failing to pass a uniqueness check - the telephone number is already in use by post "Test 1".
5. Example of PHP validation configuration. This code will fail if the request comes from "127.0.0.1" with the message "You cannot save from localhost!".
6. Example of client side PHP validation failure.

== Changelog ==
= 1.7.4 =
* Update CSS to properly handle visibility of validated fields via conditional logic when the default visibility is hidden for new entries.
* Bug fix: Remove warning when trying to access the Post ID when it is not available, on Options pages for example.


= 1.7.3 =
* Replace call to `acf_render_field_settings()` with action `acf/render_field_settings/type=?` to support ACF 5.2.3+.


= 1.7.2 =
* Allow `$message` to be returned from PHP code instead of `false` to fail validation.
  * Example code: `if ( !filter_var( $value, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL ) ) return 'You must use a valid URL.';`
  * Validation will fail if `$value` is not a URL, otherwise the default validation return is `true`.
* Clean up handling of read only/hidden select fields.
* Include additional default sub field values to prevent array index errors.
* Update to work with the latest version of ACF JavaScript validation - requires nested `<div>` to properly append error message to the correct input field.
