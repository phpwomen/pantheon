A WordPress plugin to sync content with a GitHub repository (or Jekyll site)

== Description ==
WordPress GitHub Sync does three things:

1. Allows content publishers to version their content in GitHub, exposing \"who made what change when\" to readers

2. Allows readers to submit proposed improvements to WordPress-served content via GitHub\'s Pull Request model

3. Allows non-technical writers to draft and edit a Jekyll site in WordPress\'s best-of-breed editing interface
